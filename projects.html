                    <b>About:</b><br>
                    Winter Ember is a story-driven stealth action game inspired by Thief.
                    You play as Arthur Artorias - a sole survivor of his family's massacre who now embarks on a journey to discover the truth behind the incident.
                    Winter Ember was started by Sky Machine Studios in 2018, then co-developed and published by Blowfish Studios.
                    It was later given an additional patch on those platforms and is currently being developed for Nintendo Switch.

                    <b>Comments:</b><br>
                    Winter Ember was one of the first game projects I worked on professionally.
                    It used to be managed by a more senior developer, but as I got more involved I quickly became the lead and sole developer of the project.
                    As the game was initially developed for PC, my main role was to port it to the console platforms and ensure the game runs smoothly on those platforms.
                    The Nintendo Switch port development was especially challenging due to hardware limitations.

                    Household Mecha was a game jam project developed within 48 hours. It was submitted for the GMTK Game Jam in 2021.
                    As this was a game jam, it was quite challenging trying to get things done within the time constraint.
                    We finished the implementation of the basic core gameplay, but ran out of time to implement a proper ending for the poor robot 😢

                    The more satisfied your customers are with your creations, the better your rewards.

                    <b>Comments:</b><br>
                    Slice of Life was my final year major project at college.
                    The project lasted for almost 7 months, making it the largest project I have ever worked on at the time.
                    I worked on almost all the core gameplay functionalities, with a little bit of help on the UI side from the designers.
                    Due to time constraints, there were many features that had to be omitted from the original vision, but it was a project we were proud to graduate with nonetheless.

                    VR Carnival is a VR game where you throw darts at a board to pop balloons.
                    The balloons come in different sizes and points - the smaller ones are worth more points.
                    The player's objective is to score as many points using the limited number of darts per round.
                    The player can then spend their points to unlock prizes.

                    VR Carnival was a short 2 weeks college project done for the purpose of exploring VR development.
                    I created all the core gameplay functionalities, including the dart throwing, the points system and the prize system.

                    <b>Comments:</b><br>
                    This was a college game jam project made in 24 hours spread across 3 days.
                    I created most of the functionalities, including the tower controls and enemy spawner.
                    The original plan was to allow the players to spend points for upgrades after each wave, but this feature was not implemented due to time constraints.
