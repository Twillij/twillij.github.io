                    Winter Ember is a story-driven stealth action game inspired by Thief.
                    You play as Arthur Artorias - a sole survivor of a massacre targeting your family.
                    Now, you embark on a journey to discover the truth behind the incident and deliver vengeance upon your family's killer.
                    Winter Ember was started by Sky Machine Studios in 2018, co-developed with Blowfish Studios as the publisher, and had its first release in 2022.
                    It is currently being developed for additional patch contents and Nintendo Switch.

                    <b>Comments:</b><br />
                    Winter Ember was one of the first game projects I have worked on professionally.
                    It used to be managed by a more senior developer, but as I got more involved I quickly became the lead and sole developer from the publishing side.
                    As the game was primarily developed for PC, my main role was to create the console platform ports and ensure the game runs smoothly on those platforms.

                    Household Mecha is a third person 3D puzzle platformer game on PC.
                    You play as a little toy robot whose dream is to one day become big enough to fight kaijus (giant monsters) like you see on TV shows.
                    The objective is to manuever around the house to collect and attach as many items to yourself as possible to grow big enough to leave the house.
                    Unfortunately, the level was left unfinished due to time constraints.

                    Household Mecha was a game jam project made in 24 hours spread across 2 days using Unity 2020.
                    The game was made as a submission for the GMTK Game Jam 2021.
                    Our team consisted of 1 designer and myself as the programmer.
                    My task was to create the player controls as well as the core gameplay functionalities.

                    Slice of Life is a third person monster creation simulation game on PC.
                    The objective is to go around each level collecting different body parts and assembling them to make your own unique monster.
                    Your monster creation is then submitted to the client to be rated at the end of each level.
                    The more satisfied your clients are with your creation, the better your rewards.
                    The game was uploaded to Itch.io, downloadable and playable for free.

                    <b>Comments:</b><br />
                    Slice of Life was my final year major project at college.
                    Our team consisted of 3 artists, 2 designers and myself as the sole programmer.
                    The project lasted for almost 7 months, making it the largest scale project I have ever worked on at college.
                    I worked on almost all of the core gameplay functionalities, with a little bit of help on the UI side from the designers.
                    Due to time constraints, there were many features that had to be omitted from the original vision, but it was a project we were proud to graduate with nonetheless.

                    VR Carnival is a VR PC game where you throw darts at a board to pop balloons.
                    The balloons come in different sizes and points - the smaller ones are worth more points.
                    The player's objective is to score as many points using the limited number of darts per round.
                    The player can then spend their points to unlock prizes.
